### Why is 0.1+0.2!=0.3?

Since some fractional numbers cannot be represented in base 2 (Infinite decimal), computers store those floating-point numbers as infinite decimal and it never ends, so the floating-numbers are stored inaccurately in a lot of computers. 0.1 in base 2 is 0.000110011... and 0.2 is 0.001100110... It goes close to 0.3, but never be precisely 0.3.
